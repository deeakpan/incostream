# Confidential Payroll Disbursement dApp

## Background and Motivation
The project aims to create a confidential payroll disbursement system on Base Sepolia using Inco's confidential computing platform. This addresses the privacy concerns in traditional payroll systems by:
- Hiding sensitive salary data from third parties
- Providing a trustless way to disburse payments
- Maintaining confidentiality of both amounts and identities
- Supporting Nigeria's growing gig economy and Web3 teams

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Privacy Requirements**
   - Encrypt payment amounts using Inco's private data types
   - Hide recipient identities using Inco's access control
   - Pseudonymize organization wallet addresses
   - Maintain transaction privacy on BaseScan

2. **Technical Considerations**
   - Integration with Inco's Solidity SDK for confidential computing
   - Smart contract security and access control
   - Frontend encryption/decryption using Inco's JavaScript SDK
   - Gas optimization for Base Sepolia

3. **User Experience**
   - Simple payroll setup for employers
   - Easy confirmation process for recipients
   - Clear transaction history without exposing sensitive data
   - MetaMask integration
